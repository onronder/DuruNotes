# Email Attachments Fix - Completed ✅

## The Problem
Emails with attachments were being received by the `email-inbox` function, but the attachment information wasn't being stored in the database, making them invisible in the app.

## Root Causes
1. **File data was being ignored**: When processing multipart/form-data, the function was only keeping string values and discarding File/Blob objects
2. **SendGrid's attachment-info field wasn't being parsed**: SendGrid sends attachment metadata in a JSON field called `attachment-info`
3. **No attachment metadata was being stored**: The attachment information wasn't being added to the inbox item's metadata

## The Fix

### 1. Capture File Objects
Updated the multipart/form-data processing to capture both string values and file attachments:
```typescript
if (value instanceof File || value instanceof Blob) {
  attachmentFiles.push({
    key,
    filename: value.name || key,
    size: value.size,
    type: value.type,
    file: value
  });
}
```

### 2. Parse SendGrid's attachment-info Field
Added parsing for SendGrid's `attachment-info` JSON field which contains metadata about attachments:
```typescript
if (body["attachment-info"]) {
  const attachmentInfo = JSON.parse(body["attachment-info"]);
  // Extract filename, size, content-type, etc.
}
```

### 3. Store Attachment Metadata
Attachments are now stored in the inbox item's metadata field:
```typescript
{
  metadata: {
    ...existingMetadata,
    attachments: [
      {
        filename: "document.pdf",
        size: 45678,
        content_type: "application/pdf",
        content: base64_content // if available
      }
    ],
    attachment_count: 1
  }
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Function deployed and working
- ✅ Attachment metadata is being captured
- ✅ Attachment count is returned in the response
- ✅ Attachment information is stored in the database

## How Attachments Work Now

### When SendGrid sends an email with attachments:
1. The `attachment-info` field contains JSON metadata about each attachment
2. The `attachments` field contains the count
3. Actual file data may be sent as separate form fields (if configured)

### The function now:
1. Parses the attachment-info field
2. Captures any actual file data if present
3. Stores everything in the inbox item's metadata
4. Returns the attachment count in the response

## Viewing Attachments in the App
The attachment information is stored in the `metadata` field of the `clipper_inbox` table. Your app can:
1. Check `metadata.attachment_count` to see if there are attachments
2. Access `metadata.attachments` array for details about each attachment
3. Display attachment names, sizes, and types to the user

## Test Result
Successfully tested with attachment metadata:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "inbox_id": "756ad495-c63d-4410-8e4e-45caf6b8c770",
  "attachment_count": 1
}
```

## Note
SendGrid can be configured to either:
1. **Send only metadata** (current setup) - lightweight, just info about attachments
2. **Send full file content** - includes the actual file data (requires additional SendGrid configuration)

The function now handles both scenarios.
