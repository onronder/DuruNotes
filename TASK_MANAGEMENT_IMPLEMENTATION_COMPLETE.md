### 2. Core Services
- **TaskService** (`lib/services/task_service.dart`)
  - Complete CRUD operations for tasks
  - Task statistics and analytics
  - Priority and status management
  - Subtask support

- **NoteTaskSyncService** (`lib/services/note_task_sync_service.dart`)
  - Bidirectional sync between notes and tasks
  - Markdown checkbox parsing
  - Metadata extraction (due dates, priorities)
  - Position preservation

- **TaskRepository** (`lib/repository/task_repository.dart`)
  - Backend synchronization with Supabase
  - Offline support with pending operations
  - Real-time updates
  - Conflict resolution

### 3. User Interface

  - Three view modes: List, Date Groups, Calendar
  - Advanced filtering (today, week, overdue, priority)
  - Multiple sort options
  - Task creation and editing dialogs
  - Visual priority indicators
  - Due date management

### 4. Backend Integration
- **Supabase Migration** (`supabase/migrations/20250114_note_tasks.sql`)
  - Complete table structure
  - Row Level Security policies
  - Utility functions for statistics
  - Auto-update triggers
  - Performance views

### 5. Note Editor Integration
- Automatic task extraction from checkboxes
- Real-time sync when editing notes
- Metadata support in markdown:
  - `@due(2024-12-25)` for due dates
  - `!high`, `!urgent`, `!low` for priorities
- Position tracking for accurate sync

## How to Use

### For End Users

1. **In Notes**: Use standard markdown checkboxes
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Incomplete task
   - [x] Completed task
   - [ ] Task with due date @due(2024-12-25)
   - [ ] High priority task !high
   ```

2. **Task Screen**: Access dedicated task management
   - View all tasks across notes
   - Filter by date, priority, status
   - Calendar view for visual planning
   - Create standalone tasks

### For Developers

1. **Access Services**:
   ```dart
   final taskService = ref.read(taskServiceProvider);
   final syncService = ref.read(noteTaskSyncServiceProvider);
   ```

2. **Create Tasks**:
   ```dart
   await taskService.createTask(
     noteId: 'note_id',
     content: 'Task description',
     priority: TaskPriority.high,
     dueDate: DateTime.now().add(Duration(days: 1)),
   );
   ```

3. **Watch Updates**:
   ```dart
   taskService.watchOpenTasks().listen((tasks) {
     // Handle task updates
   });
   ```
