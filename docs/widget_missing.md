🚨 Why It's Not Available Yet
The widget code is 100% complete and tested, but it needs to be:
Packaged into the app properly (Xcode configuration)
Deployed to production servers (Supabase)
Released through app stores (Apple/Google review)
Think of it like a car that's fully built but needs to be delivered to the dealership and registered before you can drive it!
🎉 Once Deployed
After these deployment steps, users will:
Update their app from the store
See the widget option in their widget gallery
Add it to their home screen
Start using it immediately!
Estimated Time to Production:
Technical deployment: 2-3 hours
