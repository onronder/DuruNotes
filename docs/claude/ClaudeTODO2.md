# üìã Duru Notes - Phase 4: Complete Core Features

> **Document Version**: 1.0.0
> **Created**: September 23, 2025
> **Purpose**: Comprehensive Phase 4 implementation plan for production-ready features
> **Duration**: 10-12 working days
> **Priority**: Core user-facing functionality (NO AI/ML features)

## üéØ Phase 4 Overview

### Current State Analysis
Based on codebase analysis, we have:
- ‚úÖ **Database Layer**: Tables for folders, templates, tasks, reminders
- ‚úÖ **Service Layer**: Import/Export, Share Extension, Task, Reminder services
- ‚úÖ **Repository Layer**: Folder, Template, Task repositories
- ‚ùå **UI Layer**: Missing management screens and user workflows
- ‚ùå **Integration**: Native platform features not connected

### Phase 4 Goals
1. Complete all user-facing features for note management
2. Implement missing UI screens and workflows
3. Connect existing services to UI
4. Enable full CRUD operations for all entities
5. Ensure offline-first functionality

### Success Metrics
- [ ] All core features accessible from UI
- [ ] Zero critical user journeys blocked
- [ ] Full offline functionality
- [ ] Import/Export working end-to-end
- [ ] Share extension operational on both platforms

class EntityManagementScreen extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
  // Standard CRUD operations
  // Consistent error handling
  // Loading states
  // Empty states
}
```

### State Management

- Implement proper loading/error states
- Cache management screens data
- Optimistic UI updates

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms
- Offline queue for failed operations
- Proper validation before operations

### Performance Considerations

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Share Extension Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with basic text sharing, add features incrementally

2. **Import Format Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Focus on Markdown first, add formats progressively

3. **Sync Conflicts**
   - Mitigation: Simple last-write-wins initially, advanced later

### Resource Risks
1. **Time Overrun**
   - Mitigation: Core features first, enhancements can be Phase 5

2. **Platform Differences**
   - Mitigation: Shared UI where possible, platform-specific only when needed
