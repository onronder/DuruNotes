# Security Architecture Review: Document Index

**Review Date**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Completed - Ready for Implementation
**Reviewer**: System Architecture Team

---

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive architectural review evaluates the security implementation for Duru Notes application across phases P0-P3. The review identified a **CRITICAL security vulnerability** (lack of userId filtering at repository layer) and provides detailed implementation guidance to address it.

### Critical Finding

**VULNERABILITY**: Current architecture allows potential cross-user data access if an attacker knows another user's note/task/folder ID.

**SEVERITY**: HIGH
**MITIGATION**: P1 implementation (repository filtering) addresses this immediately
**TIMELINE**: 2 weeks for P1 (critical fix)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: Repository = Primary Defense Layer

**Why**: All data access flows through repositories. Single enforcement point.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Service layer enforcement (duplicate code, easy to miss)
- Database triggers (performance overhead, harder to test)

**Chosen Approach**: Repository layer with Supabase RLS as backup

---

### Decision 2: Non-Nullable userId (P2)

**Why**: Database-level constraint prevents null userId at source.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep nullable with runtime checks (weaker enforcement)
- Application-level validation only (can be bypassed)

**Chosen Approach**: NOT NULL constraint + backfill migration

---

### Decision 3: Automatic Provider Lifecycle (P3)

**Why**: Manual invalidation is error-prone and unsustainable.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Code generation for provider list (complex, fragile)
- Keep manual invalidation (doesn't scale)

**Chosen Approach**: Family providers with userId parameter
