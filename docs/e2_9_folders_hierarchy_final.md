# E2.9 Folders (Hierarchy) + Pinning + Saved-Search UX - Final Implementation

## Overview
Successfully completed the end-to-end implementation of hierarchical folders, note pinning, and saved-search UX with full offline-first support. The implementation builds upon the E2.8 database v8 foundation.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. FolderRepository (Complete)
**Location**: `lib/repository/folder_repository.dart`

#### Core Methods
- `watchFolders(parentId?)` - Stream of folders, optionally filtered by parent
- `watchAllFolders()` - Stream of all folders (flat list)
- `createFolder(name, parentId?, color?, icon?, description?)` - Create with auto-path
- `renameFolder(folderId, newName)` - Rename with path recomputation
- `moveFolder(folderId, newParentId?)` - Move with recursive path updates
- `deleteFolder(folderId)` - Soft delete with note rehoming to inbox
- `moveNoteToFolder(noteId, folderId?)` - Map note to folder
- `getFolderBreadcrumbs(folderId)` - Get path as folder list
- `reorderSiblings(parentId, orderedIds)` - Reorder folders

#### Path Management
- **Single source of truth**: `path` column maintains full hierarchy
- **Automatic updates**: Path recomputed on rename/move
- **Recursive updates**: Descendant paths updated automatically
- **Breadcrumb support**: Path parsed for navigation

### 2. NotesRepository (Enhanced)
**Location**: `lib/repository/notes_repository.dart`

#### New watchNotes Method
```dart
Stream<List<LocalNote>> watchNotes({
  String? folderId,      // Filter by folder (null = all, '' = unfiled)
  List<String>? anyTags, // Include notes with any of these tags
  List<String>? noneTags,// Exclude notes with these tags
  bool pinnedFirst,      // Sort pinned notes first
  SortSpec? sort,        // Sort specification
})
```

#### Features
- **Folder filtering**: By specific folder or unfiled notes
- **Tag filtering**: Include/exclude by tags
- **Pinned grouping**: Always shows pinned notes first
- **Real-time updates**: Returns reactive stream

### 3. FolderTreeWidget
**Location**: `lib/ui/widgets/folder_tree_widget.dart`

#### Features
- **Hierarchical display**: Shows folder tree with indentation
- **Expand/collapse**: Click to expand/collapse folders
- **Inline actions**: Create, rename, move, delete via popup menu
- **Drag & drop ready**: Structure supports future DnD
- **Visual feedback**: Selected folder highlighted
- **Inbox item**: Special item for unfiled notes
- **Real-time updates**: Reacts to folder changes

#### Actions
- **Create folder/subfolder**: Inline button or menu
- **Rename**: In-place editing with confirmation
- **Move**: Dialog to select new parent
- **Delete**: Confirmation with note rehoming info

### 4. FolderBreadcrumbsWidget
**Location**: `lib/ui/widgets/folder_breadcrumbs_widget.dart`

#### Features
- **Clickable path**: Each segment navigates to that folder
- **Home button**: Quick return to root/inbox
- **Compact mode**: For limited space (e.g., app bar)
- **Custom colors**: Respects folder color settings
- **Overflow handling**: Truncates long paths intelligently

### 5. Save Current Search
**Location**: Enhanced in `lib/ui/note_search_delegate.dart`

#### Features
- **Save button**: In search bar actions
- **Name dialog**: User provides descriptive name
- **Auto-detection**: Identifies search type (text/folder/compound)
- **Parameter preservation**: Saves all filters and tokens
- **Quick access**: Snackbar action to manage searches

## Database Triggers (from E2.8)

### Folder Path Sync Triggers
These ensure FTS stays in sync with folder changes:

1. **trg_note_folders_ai/au** - Updates `fts_notes.folder_path` when note-folder mapping changes
2. **trg_note_folders_ad** - Clears `folder_path` when note removed from folder
3. **trg_local_folders_au_path** - Updates all affected notes when folder path changes

## Offline-First Architecture

### Pending Operations
All folder operations queue to `pending_ops`:
- `upsert_folder` - Create/update folder
- `delete_folder` - Soft delete folder
- `upsert_note` - When note moved to folder
- `upsert_saved_search` - Save search query
- `delete_saved_search` - Remove saved search

### Sync Behavior
- Operations work fully offline
- Queue persists across app restarts
- Sync resumes when online
- Conflict resolution prefers newest

## UI Integration Points

### Notes List Screen
- Integrated folder navigation
- Breadcrumbs in header
- Folder tree in drawer/sidebar
- Move to folder action

### Search Screen
- Save search button
- Folder filter tokens
- Saved search chips
- Search management link

### Editor Screen
- Folder indicator
- Move to folder option
- Breadcrumb navigation

## Testing Checklist

### Folder Operations ✅
- [x] Create root folder
- [x] Create subfolder
- [x] Rename folder (path updates)
- [x] Move folder (recursive path updates)
- [x] Delete folder (notes rehomed)
- [x] Reorder siblings

### Note-Folder Mapping ✅
- [x] Move note to folder
- [x] Remove from folder (to inbox)
- [x] Bulk move notes
- [x] Search by folder path

### FTS Sync ✅
- [x] Folder path in FTS on note creation
- [x] Path updates on folder rename
- [x] Path updates on folder move
- [x] Path cleared on folder removal

### Pinning ✅
- [x] Pin/unpin notes
- [x] Pinned section in list
- [x] Sort within pinned group
- [x] Persists across restarts

### Saved Searches ✅
- [x] Save from search bar

- [x] Include all filters
- [x] Reorder saved searches
- [x] Delete saved searches

### Offline Support ✅
- [x] All operations work offline
- [x] Queue persists
- [x] Sync on reconnect
- [x] No data loss

## Performance Optimizations

### Indexes
- `idx_local_folders_path` - Fast path lookups
- `idx_local_folders_parent` - Efficient child queries
- `idx_note_folders_folder` - Quick folder contents
- FTS index on `folder_path` - Fast folder search

### Query Optimization
- Joins minimized
- Subqueries for filtering
- Proper index usage
- Stream-based updates

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- Full Drift typing
- Null-safe throughout
- Proper error handling
- Clear return types

### Architecture
- Clean separation of concerns
- Repository pattern
- Reactive streams
- Offline-first design

### Documentation
- Inline documentation
- Clear method names
- Comprehensive tests
- Usage examples

## Migration Path

### From E2.8
No additional migration needed - E2.9 uses existing schema:
- `local_folders` table already present
- `note_folders` mapping table ready
- `saved_searches` table configured
- FTS with `folder_path` column
- All triggers in place

### Data Integrity
- No data loss during operations
- Orphaned notes rehomed to inbox
- Paths always consistent
- FTS always in sync

## Known Limitations

1. **No folder permissions** - All folders accessible to user
2. **No folder sharing** - Single-user only
3. **No folder templates** - Manual creation only
4. **Path length limit** - Very deep nesting may hit DB limits

## Future Enhancements

1. **Drag & Drop** - Visual note/folder moving
2. **Folder Templates** - Predefined folder structures
3. **Smart Folders** - Dynamic folders based on rules
4. **Folder Permissions** - Share with access control
5. **Folder Stats** - Note count, size, activity

## Implementation Files

### Repository Layer
- `lib/repository/folder_repository.dart` - Complete folder operations
- `lib/repository/notes_repository.dart` - Enhanced with watchNotes

### UI Components
- `lib/ui/widgets/folder_tree_widget.dart` - Hierarchical folder tree
- `lib/ui/widgets/folder_breadcrumbs_widget.dart` - Path navigation
- `lib/ui/note_search_delegate.dart` - Save search functionality

### Database
- `lib/data/local/app_db.dart` - Schema and triggers (from E2.8)

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ **Create/rename/move/delete folders** - Path correct, UI reflects immediately
✅ **Moving a note updates search** - Folder path instantly reflected in FTS
✅ **Pinned behaves as spec** - Survives restart, works offline
✅ **Saved searches restore state** - Same result set and sort preserved

## Summary

E2.9 successfully delivers a complete, production-ready folder hierarchy system with:
- Full CRUD operations with path management
- Real-time FTS synchronization
- Intuitive tree navigation with breadcrumbs
- Saved search persistence
- Complete offline-first architecture

The implementation maintains data integrity, provides excellent UX, and scales well for typical note-taking workflows. All acceptance criteria have been met with clean, maintainable code.
