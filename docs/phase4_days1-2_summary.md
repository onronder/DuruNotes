## 🔧 Critical Fix Applied

### Navigation Integration
Added menu access point in `notes_list_screen.dart`:
```dart
// Menu item added
const PopupMenuItem(
  value: 'folders',
  child: ListTile(
    leading: Icon(Icons.folder_rounded),
    title: Text('Manage Folders'),
  ),
),

// Navigation handler
case 'folders':
  Navigator.of(context).push(
    MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (context) => const FolderManagementScreen(),
    ),
  );
```
