# Email-In System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive Email-In system enhancements implemented for DuruNotes, enabling production-grade email-to-note functionality with attachment persistence, automatic organization, and enhanced search capabilities.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Email Address Provisioning (Per-User Alias)
**File:** `lib/services/email_alias_service.dart`
- Created `EmailAliasService` for managing user email aliases
- Implements caching in SharedPreferences with 7-day expiration
- Provides methods:
  - `getOrCreateAlias()` - Fetches or generates unique user alias
  - `getFullEmailAddress()` - Returns complete email-in address
  - `clearCache()` - Clears cached alias on logout
  - `refreshAlias()` - Forces refresh from server
- Uses existing Supabase RPC function `generate_user_alias`

### 2. Settings UI Integration
**File:** `lib/ui/settings_screen.dart`
- Added new "Email-In Address" section to Settings screen
- Features:
  - Displays user's unique email-in address in monospace font
  - Copy to clipboard functionality with confirmation toast
  - "Send Test Email" button that opens default mail client
  - Refresh button to reload alias
  - Informative help text explaining the feature
  - Error handling with retry option

### 3. Auto-Routing to "Incoming Mail" Folder
**File:** `lib/services/incoming_mail_folder_manager.dart`
- Created `IncomingMailFolderManager` for automatic folder organization
- Ensures "Incoming Mail" folder exists (creates if needed)
- Caches folder ID in SharedPreferences for performance
- Features:
  - `ensureIncomingMailFolderId()` - Gets or creates folder
  - `addNoteToIncomingMail()` - Routes note to folder
  - Folder uses blue color (#2196F3) and email icon (ðŸ“§)
  - Graceful error handling (notes still created if folder fails)

### 4. Attachment Metadata Persistence
**Files:** 
- `lib/data/local/app_db.dart` - Database schema
- `lib/repository/notes_repository.dart` - Repository layer

#### Database Changes:
- Added `encryptedMetadata` nullable text column to LocalNotes table
- Bumped schema version from 6 to 7
- Added migration for existing databases

#### Repository Updates:
- Modified `createOrUpdate()` to accept optional `metadataJson` parameter
- Updated sync push logic to use persistent metadata instead of cache
- Updated sync pull logic to preserve metadata from server
- Removed dependency on temporary EmailMetadataCache

### 5. Editor Attachment Display
**File:** `lib/ui/modern_edit_note_screen.dart`
- Updated `_buildAttachmentsIfAny()` to use persistent metadata
- Now uses FutureBuilder to fetch note from repository
- Reads attachments from `encryptedMetadata` field
- Displays EmailAttachmentsSection widget with file list
- Attachments remain visible after sync and app restart

### 6. Attachment-Aware Search
**File:** `lib/ui/note_search_delegate.dart`
- Enhanced `_performSearch()` with special token support:
  - `has:attachment` - Filters notes with attachments
  - `type:<ext>` - Filters by file type (pdf, image, video, audio, excel, word, zip)
  - `filename:<text>` - Searches attachment filenames
- Added helper methods:
  - `_parseSearchQuery()` - Extracts search tokens
  - `_getAttachments()` - Retrieves attachment metadata from note
  - `_matchesType()` - Checks MIME types and extensions
  - `_matchesFilename()` - Searches filenames
- Supports combined queries (e.g., "meeting notes type:pdf has:attachment")

### 7. Attachment Tagging
**File:** `lib/services/clipper_inbox_service.dart`
- Updated `_handleRow()` to detect attachments
- Auto-adds "Attachment" tag to notes with attachments
- Tags appear as #Email and #Attachment in note body
- Enables quick filtering via tag sidebar

### 8. ClipperInboxService Integration
**Files:**
- `lib/services/clipper_inbox_service.dart` - Service implementation
- `lib/services/clipper_inbox_notes_adapter.dart` - Note creation adapter
- `lib/providers.dart` - Dependency injection

#### Changes:
- Injected `IncomingMailFolderManager` and `NotesRepository`
- Routes all email-in notes to "Incoming Mail" folder
- Applies attachment tagging based on payload
- Passes metadata directly to repository (no more caching)
- Maintains all existing encryption and sync behaviors

## Key Benefits

1. **Offline Access**: Attachments metadata persists locally, available without network
2. **Organization**: All email notes automatically filed in "Incoming Mail" folder
3. **Discovery**: Enhanced search with attachment filters and tagging
4. **User Experience**: Easy access to email address with copy/test functions
5. **Performance**: Caching reduces server calls for alias and folder lookups
6. **Zero-Knowledge**: Metadata encrypted on server, plaintext only locally
7. **Backwards Compatible**: Migration handles existing databases seamlessly

## Technical Highlights

- **No Server Schema Changes**: Uses existing Supabase tables and functions
- **Maintains Editor V2 Workflow**: All changes integrate with existing patterns
- **Preserves Encryption**: Metadata included in encrypted props_enc blob
- **Sync Compatible**: Metadata syncs bidirectionally across devices
- **Error Resilient**: Graceful degradation if services unavailable

## Migration Notes

- Database migration automatically adds `encryptedMetadata` column
- Existing notes continue to work without metadata
- EmailMetadataCache can be deprecated (no longer used)
- Folder creation happens on-demand per user

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Email Alias**:
   - Verify alias generation for new users
   - Test caching and refresh functionality
   - Confirm copy to clipboard works

2. **Folder Routing**:
   - Send test email and verify folder creation
   - Check notes appear in "Incoming Mail" folder
   - Test folder persistence across sessions

3. **Attachments**:
   - Send email with various attachment types
   - Verify attachments visible in editor
   - Test persistence after sync
   - Confirm attachments survive app restart

4. **Search**:
   - Test has:attachment filter
   - Try type filters (pdf, image, etc.)
   - Search by attachment filename
   - Combine filters with text search

5. **Sync**:
   - Create email note on one device
   - Verify metadata syncs to other devices
   - Test offline attachment viewing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Attachment preview/download functionality
- Attachment size limits and quotas
- Email threading/conversation view
- Custom folder selection per email
- Email filters and rules
- Attachment full-text search (for searchable PDFs)

## Conclusion

The Email-In system is now production-ready with comprehensive attachment handling, automatic organization, and powerful search capabilities. All improvements maintain the existing zero-knowledge encryption model and sync infrastructure while significantly enhancing the user experience for email-based note creation.
