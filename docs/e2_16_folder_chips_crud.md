# E2.16 Folder Chips Full CRUD Implementation

## Summary
Implemented complete CRUD functionality for the folder chips UI with mobile-first bottom sheets and dialogs, instant UI updates via folder update streams, and comprehensive edge case handling.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Folder Chips Row Enhancement** (`lib/features/folders/folder_filter_chips.dart`)
- Added long-press gesture detection to folder chips
- Implemented action sheet with Rename/Move/Delete options
- Added haptic feedback (medium impact) on all confirmation actions
- Proper accessibility labels via tooltip property

### 2. **Create Folder Functionality**
- "New Folder" chip with `create_new_folder_outlined` icon at trailing position
- Modal bottom sheet with:
  - TextField for folder name with validation
  - Dropdown for parent folder selection (flat list)
  - Visual folder icons and colors in dropdown
  - Real-time error display for empty/duplicate names
- Auto-refreshes via `folderRepository.folderUpdates` stream

### 3. **Rename Folder**
- AlertDialog with pre-filled TextField
- Validation for:
  - Empty names (shows inline error)
  - Duplicate sibling names (queries DB for siblings)
- Success toast notification
- Maintains folder selection after rename

### 4. **Move Folder**
- DraggableScrollableSheet with parent folder picker
- Shows all folders except current folder and descendants
- "Root (No Parent)" option for moving to root level
- Prevents circular moves (handled by repository)
- Error message for invalid moves

### 5. **Delete Folder (Soft Delete)**
- Confirmation dialog with folder name in message
- Soft deletes folder (sets deleted flag)
- Automatically moves all notes to Inbox (null folder)
- If deleted folder was selected, auto-selects "All Notes"
- Shows toast: "Folder deleted, notes moved to Inbox"

### 6. **Visual States & UX**
- Selected folder chip uses filled/primary style
- Unselected chips use outlined style
- Horizontal scrolling for overflow (no vertical stacking)
- Loading skeleton animation while folders load
- Smooth slide-in animation for chips row

### 7. **Edge Cases Handled**
- **Empty names**: Shows "Folder name cannot be empty" error
- **Duplicate siblings**: Shows "A folder with this name already exists"
- **Circular moves**: Shows "Cannot move folder to its own descendant"
- **Network errors**: Graceful fallback with error toasts
- **Offline support**: All operations queue to pending_ops

### 8. **Localization**
Added all necessary strings to `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`:
- `newFolder`, `folderNameEmpty`, `folderNameDuplicate`
- `rename`, `renameFolder`, `move`, `create`
- `folderRenamed`, `folderMoved`, `folderDeleted`
- `folderDeletedNotesMovedToInbox`, `folderCreated`
- Error messages for all operations

## Files Modified
1. `lib/features/folders/folder_filter_chips.dart` - Main implementation
2. `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - Added localization strings
3. `lib/repository/folder_repository.dart` - Already had all necessary methods
4. `lib/providers.dart` - Already wired up folder streams

## Testing Notes
- Build requires `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag due to dynamic IconData creation
- All CRUD operations work offline and sync when online
- Folder updates trigger instant UI refresh via stream
- Notes properly rehomed to Inbox on folder deletion

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ Create/rename/move/delete works with instant UI refresh
- ✅ Deleting folder never deletes notes (moved to Inbox)
- ✅ No extra chip rows - horizontal scroll for overflow
- ✅ Fully offline capable with pending_ops queue
- ✅ Mobile-first bottom sheets and dialogs
- ✅ Haptic feedback and accessibility labels
- ✅ Edge cases properly handled with user-friendly errors
