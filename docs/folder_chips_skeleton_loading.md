# Folder Chips Skeleton Loading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented skeleton loading for folder chips to provide deterministic first-paint and eliminate the "sometimes empty" appearance during initial load.

## Changes

### 1. Early Provider Initialization
**File**: `lib/ui/notes_list_screen.dart`
- Added `ref.watch(rootFoldersProvider)` early in the build method
- Ensures provider starts loading immediately on widget build
- Triggers data fetch before UI needs it

### 2. Skeleton Shimmer Components

#### FolderFilterChips Widget
**File**: `lib/features/folders/folder_filter_chips.dart`
- Added `_SkeletonChips` widget with animated shimmer effect
- Shows 4 chip-shaped placeholders with varying widths (80, 90, 75, 85 pixels)
- Shimmer animation runs for 1.5 seconds with linear curve
- Seamless transition from skeleton to real chips

#### NotesListScreen Implementation
**File**: `lib/ui/notes_list_screen.dart`
- Added `_buildFolderSkeletons()` method
- Returns list of skeleton chip widgets
- Integrated into `_buildFolderNavigation()` loading state

### 3. Visual Design

#### Skeleton Appearance
- Rounded rectangles matching chip shape (20px border radius)
- Semi-transparent surface color with subtle border
- Animated gradient shimmer effect moving left to right
- Height matches actual folder chips (32px)

#### Animation Details
- Duration: 1500ms per cycle
- Animation: Linear gradient sweep
- Colors: Three-stop gradient with varying opacity
- Direction: Horizontal sweep from left to right

## User Experience

### Before
- Empty space or spinner during folder loading
- Jarring appearance when folders suddenly pop in
- Inconsistent first-paint experience

### After
- Immediate skeleton placeholders on load
- Smooth atomic swap from skeleton to real chips
- Predictable, polished loading experience
- No layout shift when content arrives

## Technical Benefits

1. **Deterministic First Paint**: Users always see something immediately
2. **No Layout Shift**: Skeletons reserve space for incoming content
3. **Perceived Performance**: App feels faster even if load time is unchanged
4. **Visual Consistency**: Loading state matches app's design language

## Testing

### Scenarios to Test
1. **Cold Start**: Launch app with no cached data
2. **Pull to Refresh**: Trigger manual refresh
3. **Folder Invalidation**: After sync or realtime update
4. **Network Delays**: Simulate slow connection

### Expected Behavior
- Skeletons appear instantly
- Shimmer animation runs smoothly
- Real chips replace skeletons atomically
- No flicker or double-render

## Implementation Notes

### Provider Initialization
The `rootFoldersProvider` is watched early in the build method to trigger immediate loading. This ensures data fetching starts before the UI requests it, reducing perceived latency.

### Skeleton Count
Shows 4 skeleton chips by default, which approximates the typical number of root folders users have. This provides realistic loading state without over-promising content.

### Animation Performance
Uses `AnimatedBuilder` with a single animation controller to ensure smooth 60fps animation without impacting scroll performance.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Adaptive Skeleton Count**: Remember last folder count per user
2. **Staggered Appearance**: Fade in chips one by one
3. **Error State Skeleton**: Different appearance for retry state
4. **Customizable Duration**: Adjust based on typical load time
