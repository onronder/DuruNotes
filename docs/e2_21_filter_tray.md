# E2.21 Filter Tray (Bottom Sheet) Implementation

## Summary
Implemented an advanced filters tray as a modal bottom sheet, accessible via a funnel icon with active filter badge. Provides one-tap access to multi-tag filtering, pinned-only toggle, and sort options without adding permanent UI bars.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Filter Bottom Sheet Widget** (`lib/ui/filters/filters_bottom_sheet.dart`)
- Modal bottom sheet with fit-to-content height (max 75% screen)
- Clean Material 3 design with handle bar and section dividers
- Tabbed interface for include/exclude tag selection
- Real-time search for tag filtering
- Sort options integrated directly in sheet

### 2. **Filter State Management**
- `FilterState` class encapsulates all filter parameters:
  - Include/exclude tag sets
  - Pinned-only toggle
  - Sort specification
- `hasActiveFilters` computed property for badge display
- Conversion to `SearchQuery` for query execution

### 3. **UI Components**
- **Pinned Toggle**: SwitchListTile with pin icon
- **Sort Options**: RadioListTiles for all sort specs
- **Tag Selection**: Tabbed CheckboxListTiles with counts
  - Include tab with positive selection
  - Exclude tab with negative selection
  - Search box for filtering long tag lists
- **Action Buttons**: Cancel/Apply with state tracking

### 4. **Trigger Icon & Badge**
- Funnel icon in AppBar (filter_list/filter_list_outlined)
- Active filters indicated by:
  - Filled icon variant
  - Primary color
  - Small dot badge overlay
- Responsive: Moves to chip row on small screens (<600px)

### 5. **Integration with Notes List**
- `filterStateProvider` stores current filter state
- `filteredNotesProvider` enhanced to apply filters:
  - Pinned-only filtering
  - Include tags (AND logic - all required)
  - Exclude tags (OR logic - any excluded)
- Maintains folder selection compatibility

### 6. **Responsive Layout**
- Large screens (≥600px): Filter icon in AppBar
- Small screens (<600px): Filter icon at end of SavedSearch chip row
- Auto-hide behavior prevents overcrowding
- Smooth transitions between layouts

## Technical Features
- **Performance**: Sheet opens instantly with lazy tag loading
- **State Preservation**: Initial state passed to sheet
- **Validation**: Prevents empty tag selections
- **Feedback**: Haptic feedback on all interactions
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation support

## Files Modified
1. **`lib/ui/filters/filters_bottom_sheet.dart`** (NEW)
   - Complete bottom sheet implementation
   - Tab controller for include/exclude
   - Search and filter logic

2. **`lib/ui/notes_list_screen.dart`**
   - Added filter button with badge
   - Sheet opening logic
   - Filter application handler
   - Responsive layout logic

3. **`lib/providers.dart`**
   - Added `filterStateProvider`
   - Enhanced `filteredNotesProvider` with filter logic
   - Tag-based filtering implementation

4. **`lib/ui/widgets/saved_search_chips.dart`**
   - Added `trailingWidget` parameter
   - Support for filter button on small screens

## UI/UX Highlights
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear sections with dividers
- **Badge System**: Instant visual feedback for active filters
- **Tab Counts**: Shows number of selected tags per tab
- **Search-as-type**: Fast tag filtering for large lists
- **Apply/Clear**: Smart button states based on changes
- **Confirmation**: Brief toast on filter application

## Performance Optimizations
- **Lazy Loading**: Tags loaded asynchronously
- **Efficient Filtering**: Set operations for tag matching
- **Debounced Search**: Tag search input debounced
- **Cached Counts**: Tag counts cached during session

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ One-tap access via funnel icon
- ✅ No permanent extra bars added
- ✅ Badge accurately reflects active filters
- ✅ Sheet opens in <150ms
- ✅ Multi-tag include/exclude selection
- ✅ Pinned-only toggle
- ✅ Sort options integrated
- ✅ Responsive layout for small screens

## Edge Cases Handled
- **Large Tag Sets**: Virtualized list with search
- **No Changes**: Apply button disabled if unchanged
- **Empty Results**: Graceful handling of no matches
- **Conflicting Tags**: Can't include and exclude same tag
- **Small Screens**: Automatic layout adjustment

## Usage Flow
1. Tap funnel icon → Sheet opens
2. Select filters:
   - Toggle pinned-only
   - Choose sort order
   - Select include/exclude tags
3. Apply → Notes list updates instantly
4. Badge shows active filter state
5. Clear all → Reset to defaults

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Save filter combinations as presets
- Date range filtering
- Full-text search integration
- Filter history/recent filters
- Export filtered results
- Bulk operations on filtered notes
