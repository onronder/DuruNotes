Typically this call is done in the \"void main()\" method. The \"ensureInitialized\" method is idempotent; calling it multiple times is not harmful. After calling that method, the \"instance\" getter will return the binding.\nIn a test, one can call \"TestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()\" as the first line in the test's \"main()\" method to initialize the binding.\nIf ServicesBinding is a custom binding mixin, there must also be a custom binding class, like WidgetsFlutterBinding, but that mixes in the selected binding, and that is the class that must be constructed before using the \"instance\" getter.",
