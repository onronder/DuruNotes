# Email Attachments Viewer - Implementation Complete

## Overview
Email attachments from inbound emails are now viewable directly within the ModernEditNoteScreen. The implementation uses signed URLs for secure access to the private storage bucket.

## Components Added

### 1. EmailAttachmentsSection Widget
**File:** `lib/ui/widgets/email_attachments_section.dart`

Features:
- Displays list of attachments with file icons based on MIME type
- Shows filename, size, and type
- "Open" button generates signed URL on-demand (60s TTL)
- In-memory cache for signed URLs to avoid regeneration
- Opens files in system viewer using `url_launcher`

### 2. Integration in ModernEditNoteScreen
**File:** `lib/ui/modern_edit_note_screen.dart`

Changes:
- Added `_buildAttachmentsIfAny()` method
- Checks `EmailMetadataCache` for attachment data
- Displays attachments section below main text field
- Only visible if note has attachments

## How It Works

### Data Flow
1. Email arrives with attachments
2. Edge function stores files in `inbound-attachments/<user_id>/<timestamp>/filename`
3. Attachment metadata (path, filename, size, type) stored in `payload_json`
4. ClipperInboxService creates note with metadata cached
5. Editor checks cache and displays attachments if present
6. User taps "Open" → signed URL generated → file opens

### Security
- ✅ Private bucket - no public access
- ✅ Signed URLs generated on-demand (never stored)
- ✅ 60-second TTL for signed URLs
- ✅ User session required (RLS enforced)
- ✅ Path includes user_id for isolation

## Testing

### Send Test Email with Attachments
```bash
./test_email_attachments.sh
```

### Expected UI
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📎 Attachments (2)              │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📄 document.txt                 │
│ 23 B • text/plain    [Open]     │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📊 data.csv                     │
│ 21 B • text/csv      [Open]     │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## File Type Icons
- 🖼️ Images: `image/*`
- 📄 PDFs: `application/pdf`
- 🎵 Audio: `audio/*`
- 🎥 Video: `video/*`
- 📊 Excel: `*excel*`, `*xls*`
- 📝 Word: `*word*`, `*doc*`
- 🗜️ Archives: `*zip*`, `*compressed*`
- 📎 Other: Default file icon

## Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations
1. **Metadata only in cache** - Attachments only visible before sync clears cache
2. **No inline preview** - Files open in external viewer
3. **No download option** - Only "Open" available

### Potential Enhancements
1. Store attachment metadata in encrypted properties during sync
2. Add inline image preview with `Image.network(signedUrl)`
3. Add "Save to Device" option
4. Show loading indicator while generating signed URL
5. Add attachment thumbnails for images

## Troubleshooting

### Attachments Not Showing
1. Check if metadata is cached:
   ```dart
   final meta = EmailMetadataCache.get(noteId);
   print('Cached metadata: $meta');
   ```

2. Verify attachment paths in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT payload_json->'attachments' 
   FROM clipper_inbox 
   WHERE source_type='email_in'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

3. Check storage bucket:
   ```sql
   SELECT name, created_at, metadata->>'size' as size
   FROM storage.objects
   WHERE bucket_id = 'inbound-attachments'
   ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

### Can't Open Attachments
1. Check signed URL generation in logs:
   ```
   [attachments] open document.txt (text/plain)
   ```

2. Verify bucket permissions allow service role access

3. Check if `url_launcher` can handle the file type

## Code Structure

```
EmailAttachmentRef
├── path: Storage path
├── filename: Display name
├── mimeType: MIME type
└── sizeBytes: File size

EmailAttachmentsSection
├── _SignedUrlCache: In-memory URL cache
├── _openAttachment(): Generate URL & launch
├── _humanSize(): Format file size
└── _iconForMime(): Select appropriate icon
```

## Acceptance Criteria ✅
- ✅ Attachments section appears when metadata has files
- ✅ Each file shows icon, name, size, type
- ✅ "Open" generates signed URL via `createSignedUrl()`
- ✅ No signed URLs persisted (only cached in memory)
- ✅ Files open in platform viewer
- ✅ No section shown when no attachments
- ✅ Graceful error handling with SnackBar

## Production Ready
The implementation is complete and ready for use. Attachments from emails are now accessible within the note editor with proper security and user experience.
