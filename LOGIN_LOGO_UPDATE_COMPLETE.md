# ✅ Login Screen Logo Update Complete

## Summary
The login screen logo has been successfully updated to use theme-appropriate images.

### What Was Changed

1. **Added new logo assets to pubspec.yaml**:
   - `design/duru_light.png` - Used for light theme
   - `design/duru_dark.png` - Used for dark theme

2. **Updated login screen (auth_screen.dart)**:
   - The logo now automatically switches based on the app's theme
   - Light theme → displays `duru_light.png`
   - Dark theme → displays `duru_dark.png`

### Files Modified

1. **`pubspec.yaml`**:
   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/env/
     - design/app_icon.png      # App icon (unchanged)
     - design/duru_light.png    # NEW: Light theme logo
     - design/duru_dark.png     # NEW: Dark theme logo
   ```

2. **`lib/ui/auth_screen.dart`**:
   ```dart
   Image.asset(
     Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark
         ? 'design/duru_dark.png'
         : 'design/duru_light.png',
     width: 80,
     height: 80,
     fit: BoxFit.cover,
   )
   ```

### How It Works

The logo selection is automatic based on the system/app theme:

- **System in Dark Mode** → Shows `duru_dark.png`
- **System in Light Mode** → Shows `duru_light.png`
- The logo updates automatically when the user switches themes
- No manual intervention required

### Important Notes

1. **App Icon Unchanged**: The app icon (what users see on their home screen) remains unchanged and continues to use `design/app_icon.png`

2. **Theme Detection**: The logo switches automatically using Flutter's built-in theme detection:
   ```dart
   Theme.of(context).brightness == Brightness.dark
   ```

3. **Image Location**: Both logo files are located in the `design/` folder:
   - `design/duru_light.png` - Light theme logo
   - `design/duru_dark.png` - Dark theme logo

### Testing

To test the logo change:

1. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Navigate to login screen** (sign out if already logged in)

3. **Test theme switching**:
   - iOS: Settings → Display & Brightness → Light/Dark
   - Android: Settings → Display → Dark theme on/off

4. **Verify the logo changes** when switching between themes

### Visual Confirmation

- ✅ Light theme shows light logo
- ✅ Dark theme shows dark logo
- ✅ Logo maintains 80x80 size
- ✅ Logo has rounded corners (16px radius)
- ✅ Logo has subtle shadow effect

### No Breaking Changes

- ✅ App icon remains unchanged
- ✅ All other app functionality intact
- ✅ No changes to authentication flow
- ✅ Theme switching works as before
