## Files Modified

### Android Native:
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Added Sentry dependencies
- `android/app/proguard-rules.pro` - Added rules for hidden APIs
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/fittechs/duruNotesApp/MainActivity.kt` - Surface management
- `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/fittechs/duruNotesApp/MainApplication.kt` - Cache cleanup
- `android/gradle.properties` - JVM performance tuning

### Flutter:
- `lib/core/android_optimizations.dart` - Android-specific optimizations
- `lib/main.dart` - Initialize Android optimizations on startup

## Performance Improvements

### Before:

- Repetitive logs: 65+ identical lines
- Sentry failures: Multiple file deletion errors
- Surface issues: 5+ disconnect failures

### After:
- âœ… Reduced GC pauses with G1GC
- âœ… Filtered repetitive logging
- âœ… Automatic cache cleanup
- âœ… Proper surface lifecycle management
- âœ… Hardware acceleration enabled

## Build Status

```bash
âœ“ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-prod-debug.apk
APK Size: 180MB (Debug build with all symbols)
```
