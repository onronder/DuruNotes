## Troubleshooting Guide

### High Battery Drain Issues
**Symptoms**: Battery drain > 8% per hour
**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check background app refresh settings
2. Verify location accuracy settings (use balanced, not high accuracy)
3. Monitor geofence frequency and radius settings
4. Check for infinite loops in reminder processing
5. Verify proper service disposal on app backgrounding

**Investigation Commands**:
```dart
// Check active geofences
final activeGeofences = await geofenceService.getActiveGeofences();

// Monitor reminder processing frequency  
final reminderStats = await reminderService.getProcessingStats();

// Check battery usage by component
final batteryReport = await BatteryMonitor.instance.generateUsageReport(
  DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 1)),
  DateTime.now(),
);
```

### Performance Degradation Issues
**Symptoms**: Operations taking > 3 seconds
**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check available memory
2. Verify network connectivity for cloud services
3. Monitor CPU usage during operations
4. Check for resource contention
5. Validate input data quality

**Investigation Commands**:
```dart
// Check system resources
final memoryUsage = await PerformanceMonitor.instance.getCurrentMemoryUsage();
final deviceInfo = await PerformanceMonitor.instance.getDevicePerformanceInfo();

// Analyze slow operations
final slowOperations = PerformanceMonitor.instance.getMetricsInRange(
  DateTime.now().subtract(Duration(hours: 1)),
  DateTime.now(),
).where((m) => m.duration > Duration(seconds: 3));
```

### Geofencing Issues
**Symptoms**: Missed geofence triggers or false positives
**Debugging Steps**:
1. Verify GPS signal strength
2. Check geofence radius settings (minimum 30m recommended)
3. Validate location permissions
4. Monitor geofence service initialization
5. Check for location service conflicts

**Investigation Commands**:
```dart
// Check location permissions
final hasPermissions = await geofenceService.hasLocationPermissions();

// Monitor geofence status
final geofenceStatus = await geofenceService.getGeofenceStatus();

// Check location accuracy
final currentLocation = await Geolocator.getCurrentPosition();
```
