## 🚀 Migration Status
- ✅ Advanced Import System → `lib/services/import_service_enhanced.dart`
- ✅ Environment Configuration → `lib/core/config/environment_config_enhanced.dart`  
- ✅ Advanced Analytics → `lib/services/analytics_enhanced/`
- ✅ Enhanced Parsers → `lib/core/parser_enhanced/`

## 🔧 Integration Steps Required

### 1. Advanced Import System Integration
```dart
// Replace existing import service with enhanced version
// Key new features:
// - ENEX format support
// - Obsidian vault import
// - Progress callbacks
// - Advanced validation
```

### 2. Environment Configuration Integration
```dart
// Update all config consumers to use enhanced version
// Key new features:
// - Multi-environment support
// - Advanced fallbacks
// - Config validation
```

### 3. Advanced Analytics Integration
```dart
// Merge enhanced analytics with existing events
// Key new features:
// - Privacy sanitization
// - Sentry integration
// - Sampling controls
```

### 4. Enhanced Parsers Integration
```dart
// Update parsing logic throughout app
// Key new features:
// - Advanced frontmatter parsing
// - Enhanced tag extraction
// - Better error handling
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] New lab features working correctly
- [ ] No regressions in core features
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
