# How to Reload the Chrome Extension

## âœ… The Issue is Fixed!

The manifest.json file was referencing wrong filenames. It's now corrected to use the actual files that exist:
- `background.js` (was looking for `background-script-production.js`)
- `content.js` (was looking for `content-script-production.js`)
- `popup.html` (was looking for `popup-production.html`)

## ðŸ“¦ To Load the Extension:

1. **Open Chrome Extensions Page**
   ```
   chrome://extensions/
   ```
   Or: Menu â†’ More Tools â†’ Extensions

2. **Enable Developer Mode**
   - Toggle the switch in the top-right corner

3. **Load the Extension**
