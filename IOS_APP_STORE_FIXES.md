# iOS App Store Submission Fixes - Completed ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ ITMS-90717: Invalid Large App Icon (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Problem:** The 1024x1024 app icon had transparency/alpha channel
**Solution:** Removed alpha channel from Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png
**Status:** Fixed - hasAlpha: no

### 2. ✅ ITMS-90788: Incomplete Document Type Configuration (WARNINGS - FIXED)
**Problem:** Missing LSHandlerRank values for document types
**Solution:** Added LSHandlerRank = "Alternate" for both:
- Markdown Document type
- PDF Document type

## What Was Done

### App Icon Fix
```bash
# Converted icon to remove alpha channel
cd ios/Runner/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset
sips -s format jpeg Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png --out temp.jpg
sips -s format png temp.jpg --out Icon-App-1024x1024@1x.png
rm temp.jpg
```

### Info.plist Updates
Added `LSHandlerRank` key with value `Alternate` to both document type configurations:
- Markdown Document: Can open .md and plain text files as an alternative app
- PDF Document: Can view PDF files as an alternative viewer

## Verification
- ✅ App icon no longer has alpha channel (hasAlpha: no)
- ✅ Both document types now have LSHandlerRank configured
- ✅ Info.plist is properly formatted

## Next Steps
1. Clean and rebuild the iOS app:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install
   flutter build ios
   ```

2. Archive and submit to App Store again

## Notes
- The LSHandlerRank value "Alternate" means your app is offered as an alternative option for opening these file types
- If you want your app to be the default handler, you could use "Default" instead
- The icon now has a white background where transparency was before (standard behavior when removing alpha)
