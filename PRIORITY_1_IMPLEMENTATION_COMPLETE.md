final undoService = ref.read(undoRedoServiceProvider);

// 2. Record operations
undoService.recordNoteFolderChange(
  noteId: note.id,
  noteTitle: note.title,
  previousFolderId: oldFolder?.id,
  previousFolderName: oldFolder?.name,
  newFolderId: newFolder?.id,
  newFolderName: newFolder?.name,
);

// 3. Perform undo
await undoService.undo();

// 4. Check availability
if (undoService.canUndo) {
  // Show undo button
}
```

### For Users:
1. **Drag notes to "All Notes"** to remove from folders
