# Pin Functionality Fix - Completed âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Pin Icon Color
- **Changed**: Pinned notes now show with primary color (blue) instead of tertiary
- **Location**: `lib/ui/notes_list_screen.dart` line 3347
- **Result**: Better visual distinction between pinned and unpinned states

### 2. List Refresh After Unpinning
- **Added**: Provider invalidation after pin toggle to refresh the notes list
- **Location**: `lib/ui/notes_list_screen.dart` lines 3310-3312
- **Result**: When you unpin a note, it immediately moves to its correct alphabetical position

## How It Works Now

### Visual Behavior
- **Pinned**: Filled pin icon (`Icons.push_pin`) with primary color (blue)
- **Unpinned**: Outlined pin icon (`Icons.push_pin_outlined`) with muted color

### Sorting Behavior
The app maintains two groups:
1. **Pinned notes** - Always shown at the top, sorted within their group
2. **Unpinned notes** - Shown below pinned notes, sorted within their group

When sorting A-Z:
- Pinned notes appear first (sorted A-Z among themselves)
- Unpinned notes appear after (sorted A-Z among themselves)

### Live Updates
When you toggle the pin:
1. The database is updated
2. The notes list providers are invalidated
3. The list re-renders with the note in its new position
4. A snackbar confirms the action

## Code Changes

### 1. Pin Button Color Update
```dart
color: widget.isPinned 
    ? widget.colorScheme.primary  // Changed from tertiary
    : widget.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant.withOpacity(0.6)
```

### 2. List Refresh on Toggle
```dart
// Refresh the notes list to show the note in its new sorted position
ref.invalidate(filteredNotesProvider);
ref.invalidate(currentNotesProvider);
```

## Testing
1. Pin a note - it should appear at the top with a blue filled icon
2. Unpin the note - it should:
   - Show an outlined icon
   - Immediately move to its alphabetical position
   - Display "Unpinned" snackbar

The sorting logic was already correctly implemented in the `_sortNotes` method (lines 1887-1926), which separates pinned and unpinned notes and sorts each group independently.
