# Scope Lock (MVP)
Wonâ€™t do in V1: Web/PWA, email-in, browser clipper, real-time co-editing, server-side LLM/embeddings.
Change control: propose any new idea via docs/changes/CR-*.md. V1 is frozen; only critical bug fixes allowed.
Gates per sprint: scripts/ci.sh passes; zero plaintext in Supabase; all SLOs are met.
