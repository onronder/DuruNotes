# üì¶ PHASE 4: Domain Migration

> **Status**: 30% COMPLETE (Infrastructure 90%, Functional 15%)
> **Priority**: P1 - Core functionality
> **Timeline**: Week 3-4 (After Phase 0 blockers)
> **Reality**: We're HERE, not in Phase 8

## üîç The Brutal Truth

### What Exists vs What Works

| Component | Infrastructure | Functional | Gap |
|-----------|---------------|------------|-----|
| **Domain Entities** | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚ùå Unused | Entities exist but app uses LocalNote |
| **Mappers** | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚ùå Rarely called | Beautiful mappers that map nothing |
| **Repositories** | ‚úÖ 100% | ‚ö†Ô∏è 50% used | Clean repos, dirty implementation |
| **Services** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 15% | ‚ö†Ô∏è 15% | 11/73 services migrated |
| **UI Components** | ‚ùå 5% | ‚ùå 5% | 2/45 components support domain |
| **Providers** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 70% | ‚ùå BROKEN | Dual architecture chaos |

### The Problem
We built a **beautiful domain architecture** then **never switched to it**. The app runs 100% on database models (`LocalNote`, `LocalFolder`, `NoteTask`) while domain entities sit unused.

## üìã Migration Components

### [1. UI Component Migration](./TODO_PHASE4_1_UI.md)
**Status**: 5% (2/45 components) | **Time**: 60 hours

Current Reality:
- ‚úÖ notes_list_screen.dart (50% migrated)
- ‚úÖ DualTypeNoteCard (supports both)
- ‚ùå 43 components still use database models

Must Migrate:
- modern_edit_note_screen.dart (critical)
- task_list_screen.dart
- folder_management_screen.dart
- All 43 remaining components

### [2. Service Migration](./TODO_PHASE4_2_SERVICES.md)
**Status**: 15% (11/73 services) | **Time**: 80 hours

Completed Services:
- ‚úÖ UnifiedExportService
- ‚úÖ UnifiedImportService
- ‚úÖ UnifiedTaskService
- ‚úÖ 8 more unified services

Remaining:
- ‚ùå 62 services still need migration
- Critical: NotificationService, AuthService, CryptoService

### [3. Provider Refactoring](./TODO_PHASE4_3_PROVIDERS.md)
**Status**: BROKEN | **Time**: 40 hours

Current Problems:
- 107 conditional providers
- Feature flags everywhere
- Type safety broken (dynamic)
- 1,669 lines of chaos

Must Fix:
- Remove ALL conditionals
- Split into modules
- Fix type safety
- Clean architecture

### [4. Test Coverage](./TODO_PHASE4_4_TESTING.md)
**Status**: 15% overall | **Time**: 60 hours

Current Coverage:
- Domain: 0% (need 95%)
- Repositories: 0% (need 90%)
- Services: 30% (need 85%)
- UI: 10% (need 75%)
- Integration: 5% (need 60%)

## üéØ Migration Strategy

### Step 1: Fix the Switch (Week 3, Day 1-2)
```dart
// lib/providers.dart - THE KILLER LINE
const bool useRefactoredArchitecture = false;  // CHANGE TO TRUE!
```

But first:
1. Ensure all mappers work
2. Verify repositories connected
3. Test domain entities
4. Update providers
5. THEN flip the switch

### Step 2: Component by Component (Week 3, Day 3-5)
Start with least coupled:
1. Settings screens (no data deps)
2. Auth screens (simple data)
3. Search screens (read-only)
4. List screens (display only)
5. Edit screens (complex - last)

### Step 3: Service Migration (Week 4, Day 1-3)
Migrate in dependency order:
1. Leaf services (no deps)
2. Utility services
3. Data services
4. Core services
5. Orchestration services

### Step 4: Testing (Week 4, Day 4-5)
1. Unit tests for each migrated component
2. Integration tests for workflows
3. E2E tests for critical paths
4. Performance regression tests

## üö´ Migration Rules

1. **No Partial Migration**: Component is either 100% migrated or 0%
2. **No Mixed Models**: Use domain OR database, never both
3. **Test As You Go**: Every migration needs a test
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility
5. **Document Decisions**: Log why you made choices

## üîß Helpful Commands

```bash
# Find database model usage in UI
grep -r "LocalNote\|LocalFolder\|NoteTask" lib/ui/

# Find legacy service calls
grep -r "legacyService\|oldService" lib/

# Check domain entity usage
grep -r "domain\.Note\|domain\.Folder" lib/

# Find conditional providers
grep -r "conditional\|isFeatureEnabled" lib/

# Test migration
flutter test test/migration/

# Verify no regressions
flutter test --coverage
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Migration Pitfalls

1. **Mixing Models**: Using both LocalNote and domain.Note
2. **Incomplete Migration**: Migrating UI but not service
3. **Breaking Tests**: Not updating tests after migration
4. **Type Confusion**: Using dynamic to avoid fixing types
5. **Performance Hit**: Not optimizing after migration
6. **Lost Features**: Forgetting to migrate all functionality
7. **State Issues**: Not migrating provider state properly

---

## üéâ When Complete

### You'll Have:
- Clean domain-driven architecture
- Type-safe throughout
- Testable components
- Maintainable codebase
- 40% faster development

### You Can:
- Add features in hours not days
- Test with confidence
- Onboard developers quickly
- Scale to millions of users
- Sleep at night

**Remember**: We're at 15% functional migration, not 100%. Face reality, fix it properly.
