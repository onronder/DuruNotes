# Email Inbox Function - Fixed! ✅

## The Problem
The `email-inbox` function was returning 404 errors when receiving emails from SendGrid, even though the alias existed in the database.

## Root Cause
SendGrid was sending the recipient email in this format:
```
"note_test1234@in.durunotes.app" <note_test1234@in.durunotes.app>
```

The regex pattern was incorrectly capturing `"note_test1234` (with the leading quote) instead of just `note_test1234`.

## The Fix
1. **Updated the regex pattern** to exclude quotes from the alias extraction:
   - Old: `/([^@+<>\s]+)(?:\+[^@]*)?@/`
   - New: `/([^@+<>\s"']+)(?:\+[^@]*)?@/`

2. **Added proper envelope parsing** for SendGrid's JSON format:
   - SendGrid sends the `envelope` field as a JSON string when using multipart/form-data
   - Added JSON parsing for the envelope field
   - Extract recipient from `envelope.to` array if the main `to` field is empty

3. **Enhanced logging** to better debug future issues

## Test Results
Successfully tested with SendGrid's exact format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Email processed successfully",
  "inbox_id": "e34c3556-5e61-4491-bdb5-6da8697e537c",
  "user_id": "49b58975-6446-4482-bed5-5c6b0ec46675",
  "alias": "note_test1234",
  "attachment_count": 0
}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Function deployed and working
- ✅ Correctly parsing quoted email addresses
- ✅ Handling SendGrid's envelope field format
- ✅ Storing emails in the database with correct alias
