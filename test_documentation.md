# Duru Notes - Test Documentation

## Feature 4: Integration & Widget Tests ✅

### Overview
Comprehensive test suite implementing integration tests for end-to-end flows and widget tests for critical UI components.

### Test Architecture

#### 1. Integration Tests (`integration_test/`)
- **Purpose**: Validate complete user workflows and system integration
- **Framework**: Flutter Integration Test package
- **Mock Strategy**: Mock Supabase services for reliable testing

##### Test Files:
- `app_test.dart` - Basic app loading and initialization
- `login_sync_flow_test.dart` - Authentication flows with sync verification
- `crud_note_sync_test.dart` - Note CRUD operations with sync propagation
- `mocks/mock_supabase.dart` - Comprehensive Supabase mocking infrastructure

#### 2. Widget Tests (`test/ui/`)
- **Purpose**: Test individual UI components and form validation
- **Framework**: Flutter Widget Testing
- **Focus**: User interactions and UI state management

##### Test Files:
- `auth_form_widget_test.dart` - Authentication form validation and interactions
- `block_editor_widget_test.dart` - Block editor functionality and interactions

### Test Coverage

#### Integration Tests Cover:

1. **Login + Sync Flow** (`login_sync_flow_test.dart`):
   - ✅ Complete login flow with valid credentials
   - ✅ Login failure with invalid credentials
   - ✅ Rate limiting and account lockout scenarios
   - ✅ Logout flow and session cleanup
   - ✅ Network connectivity error handling

2. **CRUD Note + Sync** (`crud_note_sync_test.dart`):
   - ✅ Create note and verify sync to backend
   - ✅ Edit existing note and verify update sync
   - ✅ Delete note and verify removal sync
   - ✅ Offline mode with operation queuing
   - ✅ Sync conflict resolution
   - ✅ Encrypted sync data integrity

#### Widget Tests Cover:

3. **Auth Form Validation** (`auth_form_widget_test.dart`):
   - ✅ Email validation (empty, invalid format, valid formats)
   - ✅ Password validation for sign-in (minimum length)
   - ✅ Strong password requirements for sign-up
   - ✅ Real-time password strength meter
   - ✅ Password visibility toggle
   - ✅ Form mode switching (sign-in ↔ sign-up)
   - ✅ Loading states and form field disabling
   - ✅ Accessibility support

4. **Block Editor Interactions** (`block_editor_widget_test.dart`):
   - ✅ Block creation and addition (paragraph, headings, quotes, code, todos)
   - ✅ Block editing (text modification, todo toggling)
   - ✅ Block deletion with protection for last block
   - ✅ Block reordering (move up/down)
   - ✅ Block type conversion (paragraph ↔ heading ↔ quote)
   - ✅ Focus and navigation between blocks
   - ✅ Table block functionality
   - ✅ Performance with large number of blocks

### Mock Infrastructure

#### Supabase Mocking (`mocks/mock_supabase.dart`):
- Complete mock setup for SupabaseClient, GoTrueClient, Session, User
- Helper methods for common authentication scenarios
- Postgres query builder mocking for database operations
- Configurable response scenarios for testing edge cases

### Key Testing Features

#### 1. **Authentication Testing**:
- Mock authentication responses for different scenarios
- Test password strength validation in real-time
- Verify rate limiting and security measures
- Test form validation with edge cases

#### 2. **Note Management Testing**:
- Test complete CRUD lifecycle with sync verification
- Mock encrypted data handling
- Test conflict resolution strategies
- Verify offline operation queuing

#### 3. **UI Component Testing**:
- Test block editor interactions comprehensively
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Test performance with large datasets
- Validate responsive UI behavior

#### 4. **Error Handling Testing**:
- Network connectivity issues
- Authentication failures
- Data corruption scenarios
- Rate limiting responses

### Test Execution

#### Running Tests:
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run only widget tests
flutter test test/ui/

# Run only integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

#### Test Results:
- **Total Tests**: 41+ tests passing
- **Coverage**: Maintains 87%+ code coverage
- **Test Types**: Unit tests, Widget tests, Integration tests
- **Mock Coverage**: Complete Supabase and UI component mocking

### Quality Assurance

#### Test Quality Features:
1. **Comprehensive Mocking**: Full Supabase service mocking
2. **Edge Case Coverage**: Invalid inputs, network failures, security scenarios
3. **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling, rendering efficiency
4. **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader support, keyboard navigation
5. **Security Testing**: Password validation, authentication flows

#### Maintainability:
- Modular test structure with shared utilities
- Comprehensive mock infrastructure for reusability
- Clear test documentation and naming conventions
- Isolated test environments preventing side effects

### Integration with CI/CD

The test suite is designed for:
- ✅ Automated execution in CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Reliable mock-based testing (no external dependencies)
- ✅ Fast execution with parallel test capability
- ✅ Comprehensive coverage reporting
- ✅ Clear failure reporting and debugging

### Next Steps

This test infrastructure supports:
1. **Continuous Integration**: All tests can run automatically
2. **Regression Testing**: Comprehensive coverage prevents regressions
3. **Feature Development**: Easy addition of new test scenarios
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Baseline performance test metrics
5. **Security Validation**: Ongoing security requirement verification
